# MPCMP_Test_bowlers
Code to implement MCMC scheme for truncated mean-parameterised Conway-Maxwell-Poisson regression model to analyse Test match bowlers.

The code requires a number of inputs to run. A suitable dataset is included in the repository.

As the code implements an MCMC scheme it is recommended to run for a suitable number of iterations in order to achieve convergence.
